Opinionated frontend monorepo with focus on best practices and painless developer experience:

- Monorepo setup can be easily extended with custom libraries or into micro-frontend architecture ðŸ”§
- Spin it up with single command ðŸŒ€
- Blazing fast builds with Turborepo [remote caching](https://turborepo.org/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) âš¡
- TypeScript 100% codebase

## Requirements

- [Node v18+](https://nodejs.org/)

## Running

_Easily set up a local development environment_

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` - Start all NextJs apps ðŸš€

Visit one of the monorepo apps [localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100/)

## Features:

- [Turborepo v1](https://turborepo.org/) remote cache build system, with blazingly fast execution of commands (build, lint, test etc.) on your local machine and CI
- [TypeScript v4](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) codebase with [Strict Configuration](https://typescript-eslint.io/docs/linting/configs#strict)
- [NextJs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) apps
- [Material UI component](https://github.com/mkosir/turborepo-boilerplate/tree/main/packages/ui) library built with [MUI v5](https://mui.com/) and shared theme across all apps and packages
- Unit and integration tests with [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library). Run a single test in any monorepo app/package [instantly](https://github.com/firsttris/vscode-jest/raw/master/public/vscode-jest.gif).
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter
- Git hooks with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
- Commit messages must meet [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.  
  After staging changes just run `npm run commit` and get instant feedback on your commit message formatting and be prompted for required fields by [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

## Conventions

Convention over configuration should be followed as much as possible as described in [Conventions.md](https://github.com/mkosir/turborepo-boilerplate/blob/main/README_CONVENTIONS.md)

## Monorepo

Monorepo features and conventions:

- Monorepo is being quite highly opinionated in order to achieve best developer experience. It's meant to be used as frontend only monorepo, 100% TypeScript, Material UI support (UI component library, shared theme across all apps and packages etc.), consistent codebase across whole monorepo with automated tooling in place as ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, conventional commits etc.
- Workspaces:
  - It comes with two workspaces `apps` and `packages`.
  - All configurations (eslint, jest, material ui etc.) in `packages` are always prefixed with "config-" and imported into other workspaces directly from source without building (never transpiled).
  - All other `packages` beside configurations are always being built/transpiled and output to `dist/` folder.
- All applications in monorepo are built with Next.js.
- All Next.js applications are [statically exported](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export).
- Monorepo doesn't include any implementation of micro-frontend architecture, but is prepared with that in mind, so it can be easily extended (adding shared state, page composition etc.)
